| 3      | Defenders of the Keystore        | https://github.com/TheNetworkNerd/VMworldHackathon2017_DefendersOfTheKeystore | Our goal was to encrypt two VMs using Hytrust as the KMS, which involves deploying a two-node Hytrust cluster, registering and configuring the KMS nodes with vCenter, creating VMs to encrypt, and actually turning on encryption for the VMs in question so a vSphere admin could just start using VM Encryption. |
| 4      | SABUtage                         | https://github.com/tlindsay42/VMworldHackathon2017_SABUtage                   | Our goal was to use PowerCLI to automate an end-to-end setup of a vSAN stretched cluster. Right now, there are a bunch of manual steps involved around HA, DRS, affinity groups, etc. The objective will be to have this automated (and learn something along the way)                                              |

Also create a web front end that will show what requests are being made to the echo, with details about the request.                                                             |

Long term goal, build a tool which can take any given vCenter environment, then replicate the settings and configuration to any other vCenter.                                |

## Environment Details

Each team will be provided with a "vPod" environment that consists of the following:
  * 1 x vCenter Server Appliance (vSphere 6.5 Update 1)
  * 3 x Nested ESXi hosts (vSphere 6.5 Update 1)
  * vSAN will be the underlying storage (vSAN 6.6.1) within the Nested enviornment
  * VCSA is configured as 2 vCPU & 8GB memory
  * Each ESXi host will have 10GB memory
  * There is ~75GB of usable storage within the vPod (which can be expanded if required)
  * For additional product deployments, this will happen outside of the vPod (aka Layer1 on the phyiscal vSAN Cluster)
  * More details will be provided at the Hackathon

In addition, the following vSphere Content Library will be made available to all teams to use during the Hackathon to deploy additional solutions that are needed:

## vSphere Web Client Customization

Download the [websso.war](vSphere-Web-Client-2017-Customization/websso.war) package copy that to the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) located under **/usr/lib/vmware-sso/vmware-sts/webapps**. If you wish to create your own customization based on this theme, you can following this blog post [here](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/vmworld-hackathon-vsphere-client-login-ui-theme.html)

**Note:** The websso.war has been created specifically for a vSphere 6.5 Update 1 environment. Simply copying this to earlier version of vSphere probably will not work and you will need to use follow this blog post [here](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/vmworld-hackathon-vsphere-client-login-ui-theme.html) to create the customization for earlier versions of vSphere.
