| 1      | Hacking hard, or hardly hacking? | https://github.com/davidseibel/vSphereSCG                                     | Our goal was to create a framework that would allow for scripted auditing and remediation of a vSphere environment against the Security Configuration Guide, or other user-defined standard                                                                                                                         |

| 3      | Defenders of the Keystore        | https://github.com/TheNetworkNerd/VMworldHackathon2017_DefendersOfTheKeystore | Our goal was to encrypt two VMs using Hytrust as the KMS, which involves deploying a two-node Hytrust cluster, registering and configuring the KMS nodes with vCenter, creating VMs to encrypt, and actually turning on encryption for the VMs in question so a vSphere admin could just start using VM Encryption. |

Right now, there are a bunch of manual steps involved around HA, DRS, affinity groups, etc. The objective will be to have this automated (and learn something along the way)                                              |

Long term goal, build a tool which can take any given vCenter environment, then replicate the settings and configuration to any other vCenter.                                |
